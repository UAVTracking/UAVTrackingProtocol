# UAV Tracking Open Protocol

## Participation

See the work in progress in the [draft version](https://github.com/UAVTracking/UAVTrackingProtocol/blob/master/draft/README.md).

Raise [a new issue](https://github.com/UAVTracking/UAVTrackingProtocol/issues/new) if something catches your attention.

Submit an *atomic* pull-request if you are comfortable with Github’s workflow or send us an email and we will create the pull-request for you.

Set yourself as a “watcher” to be notified of all discussions about the work in progress.


## Arbitration

Each pull-request is kept open for at least 24 hours (except for cosmetic/typo ones). It allows watchers to express themselves and raise potential issues prior to merging it into the specification (`master` branch).

Please address your concerns directly on the relevant line of the diff (“files” tab of the pull-request). Note that you need to be logged in to be able to comment.
